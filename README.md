# photoSite
Very scuffed website for showing photos (and videos) grouped by events.

You can create events, delete events, upload photos linked to an event, delete photos (right click to select them in the event page),
and see the location in which they were taken.

(Wow amazing!)

You can also create accounts to give your friends access to your website without giving them permission to upload/delete photos

(Even more wow!) ðŸ¦§
